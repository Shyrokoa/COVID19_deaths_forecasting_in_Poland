# COVID19_deaths_forecasting_in_Poland
This project discusses the basic machine learning algorithms for regression tasks. Based on these algorithms, I will evaluate the learning quality of each algorithm in terms of learning speed and the quality of the results. Also, using trained models, I will predict the coronavirus deaths in Poland in the near future.
